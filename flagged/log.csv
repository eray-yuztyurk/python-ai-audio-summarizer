Agile is a modern software development approach that focuses on flexibility, collaboration and delivering value in small, frequent increments. Instead of creating long project plans and trying to follow them step by step, Agile accepts that requirements will change and that the best way to build the right product is to work in short cycles, get feedback early and adjust quickly. Agile teams work in short time periods called sprints, usually around two weeks, and during each sprint they plan the work, develop the features, test them and deliver a working piece of the product. This means the customer sees progress much sooner and can give feedback before the team goes too far in the wrong direction. Agile emphasises communication inside the team, close involvement of the customer and continuous improvement. 

The Agile Manifesto summarizes this mindset by valuing people and interactions over strict processes, working software over long documents, collaboration with customers over contract details and responding to change rather than blindly following a plan. In practice, Agile helps teams reduce risk, find issues earlier, stay aligned with business goals and adapt to changes without wasting time. Over time the team also becomes more efficient because every sprint ends with a review of what went well and what can be improved. Agile’s focus on delivering small, working pieces of software frequently makes it one of the most effective approaches for building products in environments where requirements evolve and speed matters.

Simple Agile steps:
1 - Sprint planning
2 - Daily work and daily stand-up
3 - Ongoing development and testing
4 - Delivering a working product increment
5 - Sprint review
6 - Sprint retrospective",,,,,2025-12-11 22:57:23.885769
